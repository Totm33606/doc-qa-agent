# Body - Fields

The same way you can declare additional validation and metadata in *path operation function* parameters with `Query`, `Path` and `Body`, you can declare validation and metadata inside of Pydantic models using Pydantic's `Field`.

## Import `Field`

First, you have to import it:

```python
from typing import Annotated

from fastapi import Body, FastAPI
from pydantic import BaseModel, Field

app = FastAPI()


class Item(BaseModel):
    name: str
    description: str | None = Field(
        default=None, title="The description of the item", max_length=300
    )
    price: float = Field(gt=0, description="The price must be greater than zero")
    tax: float | None = None


@app.put("/items/{item_id}")
async def update_item(item_id: int, item: Annotated[Item, Body(embed=True)]):
    results = {"item_id": item_id, "item": item}
    return results
```


> **WARNING:**
> Notice that `Field` is imported directly from `pydantic`, not from `fastapi` as are all the rest (`Query`, `Path`, `Body`, etc).


## Declare model attributes

You can then use `Field` with model attributes:

```python
from typing import Annotated

from fastapi import Body, FastAPI
from pydantic import BaseModel, Field

app = FastAPI()


class Item(BaseModel):
    name: str
    description: str | None = Field(
        default=None, title="The description of the item", max_length=300
    )
    price: float = Field(gt=0, description="The price must be greater than zero")
    tax: float | None = None


@app.put("/items/{item_id}")
async def update_item(item_id: int, item: Annotated[Item, Body(embed=True)]):
    results = {"item_id": item_id, "item": item}
    return results
```

`Field` works the same way as `Query`, `Path` and `Body`, it has all the same parameters, etc.

> **Technical Details:**
> Actually, `Query`, `Path` and others you'll see next create objects of subclasses of a common `Param` class, which is itself a subclass of Pydantic's `FieldInfo` class.
>
> And Pydantic's `Field` returns an instance of `FieldInfo` as well.
>
> `Body` also returns objects of a subclass of `FieldInfo` directly. And there are others you will see later that are subclasses of the `Body` class.
>
> Remember that when you import `Query`, `Path`, and others from `fastapi`, those are actually functions that return special classes.


> **TIP:**
> Notice how each model's attribute with a type, default value and `Field` has the same structure as a *path operation function's* parameter, with `Field` instead of `Path`, `Query` and `Body`.


## Add extra information

You can declare extra information in `Field`, `Query`, `Body`, etc. And it will be included in the generated JSON Schema.

You will learn more about adding extra information later in the docs, when learning to declare examples.

> **WARNING:**
> Extra keys passed to `Field` will also be present in the resulting OpenAPI schema for your application.
> As these keys may not necessarily be part of the OpenAPI specification, some OpenAPI tools, for example [the OpenAPI validator](https://validator.swagger.io/), may not work with your generated schema.


## Recap

You can use Pydantic's `Field` to declare extra validations and metadata for model attributes.

You can also use the extra keyword arguments to pass additional JSON Schema metadata.
