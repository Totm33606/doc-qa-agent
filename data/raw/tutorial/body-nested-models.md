# Body - Nested Models

With **FastAPI**, you can define, validate, document, and use arbitrarily deeply nested models (thanks to Pydantic).

## List fields

You can define an attribute to be a subtype. For example, a Python `list`:

```python
from fastapi import FastAPI
from pydantic import BaseModel

app = FastAPI()


class Item(BaseModel):
    name: str
    description: str | None = None
    price: float
    tax: float | None = None
    tags: list = []


@app.put("/items/{item_id}")
async def update_item(item_id: int, item: Item):
    results = {"item_id": item_id, "item": item}
    return results
```

This will make `tags` be a list, although it doesn't declare the type of the elements of the list.

## List fields with type parameter

But Python has a specific way to declare lists with internal types, or "type parameters":

### Declare a `list` with a type parameter

To declare types that have type parameters (internal types), like `list`, `dict`, `tuple`,
pass the internal type(s) as "type parameters" using square brackets: `[` and `]`

```Python
my_list: list[str]
```

That's all standard Python syntax for type declarations.

Use that same standard syntax for model attributes with internal types.

So, in our example, we can make `tags` be specifically a "list of strings":

```python
from fastapi import FastAPI
from pydantic import BaseModel

app = FastAPI()


class Item(BaseModel):
    name: str
    description: str | None = None
    price: float
    tax: float | None = None
    tags: list[str] = []


@app.put("/items/{item_id}")
async def update_item(item_id: int, item: Item):
    results = {"item_id": item_id, "item": item}
    return results
```

## Set types

But then we think about it, and realize that tags shouldn't repeat, they would probably be unique strings.

And Python has a special data type for sets of unique items, the `set`.

Then we can declare `tags` as a set of strings:

```python
from fastapi import FastAPI
from pydantic import BaseModel

app = FastAPI()


class Item(BaseModel):
    name: str
    description: str | None = None
    price: float
    tax: float | None = None
    tags: set[str] = set()


@app.put("/items/{item_id}")
async def update_item(item_id: int, item: Item):
    results = {"item_id": item_id, "item": item}
    return results
```

With this, even if you receive a request with duplicate data, it will be converted to a set of unique items.

And whenever you output that data, even if the source had duplicates, it will be output as a set of unique items.

And it will be annotated / documented accordingly too.

## Nested Models

Each attribute of a Pydantic model has a type.

But that type can itself be another Pydantic model.

So, you can declare deeply nested JSON "objects" with specific attribute names, types and validations.

All that, arbitrarily nested.

### Define a submodel

For example, we can define an `Image` model:

```python
from fastapi import FastAPI
from pydantic import BaseModel

app = FastAPI()


class Image(BaseModel):
    url: str
    name: str


class Item(BaseModel):
    name: str
    description: str | None = None
    price: float
    tax: float | None = None
    tags: set[str] = set()
    image: Image | None = None


@app.put("/items/{item_id}")
async def update_item(item_id: int, item: Item):
    results = {"item_id": item_id, "item": item}
    return results
```

### Use the submodel as a type

And then we can use it as the type of an attribute:

```python
from fastapi import FastAPI
from pydantic import BaseModel

app = FastAPI()


class Image(BaseModel):
    url: str
    name: str


class Item(BaseModel):
    name: str
    description: str | None = None
    price: float
    tax: float | None = None
    tags: set[str] = set()
    image: Image | None = None


@app.put("/items/{item_id}")
async def update_item(item_id: int, item: Item):
    results = {"item_id": item_id, "item": item}
    return results
```

This would mean that **FastAPI** would expect a body similar to:

```JSON
{
    "name": "Foo",
    "description": "The pretender",
    "price": 42.0,
    "tax": 3.2,
    "tags": ["rock", "metal", "bar"],
    "image": {
        "url": "http://example.com/baz.jpg",
        "name": "The Foo live"
    }
}
```

Again, doing just that declaration, with **FastAPI** you get:

* Editor support (completion, etc.), even for nested models
* Data conversion
* Data validation
* Automatic documentation

## Special types and validation

Apart from normal singular types like `str`, `int`, `float`, etc. you can use more complex singular types that inherit from `str`.

To see all the options you have, check out [Pydantic's Type Overview](https://pydantic.dev/docs/validation/latest/concepts/types/). You will see some examples in the next chapter.

For example, as in the `Image` model we have a `url` field, we can declare it to be an instance of Pydantic's `HttpUrl` instead of a `str`:

```python
from fastapi import FastAPI
from pydantic import BaseModel, HttpUrl

app = FastAPI()


class Image(BaseModel):
    url: HttpUrl
    name: str


class Item(BaseModel):
    name: str
    description: str | None = None
    price: float
    tax: float | None = None
    tags: set[str] = set()
    image: Image | None = None


@app.put("/items/{item_id}")
async def update_item(item_id: int, item: Item):
    results = {"item_id": item_id, "item": item}
    return results
```

The string will be checked to be a valid URL, and documented in JSON Schema / OpenAPI as such.

## Attributes with lists of submodels

You can also use Pydantic models as subtypes of `list`, `set`, etc.:

```python
from fastapi import FastAPI
from pydantic import BaseModel, HttpUrl

app = FastAPI()


class Image(BaseModel):
    url: HttpUrl
    name: str


class Item(BaseModel):
    name: str
    description: str | None = None
    price: float
    tax: float | None = None
    tags: set[str] = set()
    images: list[Image] | None = None


@app.put("/items/{item_id}")
async def update_item(item_id: int, item: Item):
    results = {"item_id": item_id, "item": item}
    return results
```

This will expect (convert, validate, document, etc.) a JSON body like:

```JSON hl_lines="11"
{
    "name": "Foo",
    "description": "The pretender",
    "price": 42.0,
    "tax": 3.2,
    "tags": [
        "rock",
        "metal",
        "bar"
    ],
    "images": [
        {
            "url": "http://example.com/baz.jpg",
            "name": "The Foo live"
        },
        {
            "url": "http://example.com/dave.jpg",
            "name": "The Baz"
        }
    ]
}
```

> **NOTE:**
> Notice how the `images` key now has a list of image objects.


## Deeply nested models

You can define arbitrarily deeply nested models:

```python
from fastapi import FastAPI
from pydantic import BaseModel, HttpUrl

app = FastAPI()


class Image(BaseModel):
    url: HttpUrl
    name: str


class Item(BaseModel):
    name: str
    description: str | None = None
    price: float
    tax: float | None = None
    tags: set[str] = set()
    images: list[Image] | None = None


class Offer(BaseModel):
    name: str
    description: str | None = None
    price: float
    items: list[Item]


@app.post("/offers/")
async def create_offer(offer: Offer):
    return offer
```

> **NOTE:**
> Notice how `Offer` has a list of `Item`s, which in turn have an optional list of `Image`s


## Bodies of pure lists

If the top level value of the JSON body you expect is a JSON `array` (a Python `list`), you can declare the type in the parameter of the function, the same as in Pydantic models:

```Python
images: list[Image]
```

as in:

```python
from fastapi import FastAPI
from pydantic import BaseModel, HttpUrl

app = FastAPI()


class Image(BaseModel):
    url: HttpUrl
    name: str


@app.post("/images/multiple/")
async def create_multiple_images(images: list[Image]):
    return images
```

## Editor support everywhere

And you get editor support everywhere.

Even for items inside of lists:

<img src="/img/tutorial/body-nested-models/image01.png">

You couldn't get this kind of editor support if you were working directly with `dict` instead of Pydantic models.

But you don't have to worry about them either, incoming dicts are converted automatically and your output is converted automatically to JSON too.

## Bodies of arbitrary `dict`s

You can also declare a body as a `dict` with keys of some type and values of some other type.

This way, you don't have to know beforehand what the valid field/attribute names are (as would be the case with Pydantic models).

This would be useful if you want to receive keys that you don't already know.

---

Another useful case is when you want to have keys of another type (e.g., `int`).

That's what we are going to see here.

In this case, you would accept any `dict` as long as it has `int` keys with `float` values:

```python
from fastapi import FastAPI

app = FastAPI()


@app.post("/index-weights/")
async def create_index_weights(weights: dict[int, float]):
    return weights
```

> **TIP:**
> Keep in mind that JSON only supports `str` as keys.
>
> But Pydantic has automatic data conversion.
>
> This means that, even though your API clients can only send strings as keys, as long as those strings contain pure integers, Pydantic will convert them and validate them.
>
> And the `dict` you receive as `weights` will actually have `int` keys and `float` values.


## Recap

With **FastAPI** you have the maximum flexibility provided by Pydantic models, while keeping your code simple, short and elegant.

But with all the benefits:

* Editor support (completion everywhere!)
* Data conversion (a.k.a. parsing / serialization)
* Data validation
* Schema documentation
* Automatic docs
